# Beat Mix

## Project Overview

In this project, you will write functions to implement logic for a beat-making music machine. By the end, you will have an application that can loop over a 16-step grid of four drum types and play them when they are activated. You will also write the functionality to invert each row of drums, clear each row of drums, or clear the entire board. Finally, you will build the functionality to retrieve and save presets to a server.
